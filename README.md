# Clean API Base in Node.js

This repository is designed exclusively to provide a quick starting point for creating APIs in Node.js.

It includes only the basic Express configuration with TypeScript and the initial router.

## Installation
You can clone the repository and run:
```bash
npm install
```
And update the environment variables as needed.

## Usage
To run the project, use the standard command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Additional Notes
If desired, it’s a good idea to remove the repository’s `origin` and add your own remote repository to continue development.

To view remote repositories:
```bash
git remote -v
```

To change the origin:
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <url>
```
Where `<url>` is the path to your remote repository.
